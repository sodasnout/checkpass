# CheckPass Utility #
CheckPass is an utility you can use for verifying whether your password is potentially unique. It checks against the files
from the large known-passwords repository located at [https://github.com/nrakochy/known-passwords](https://github.com/nrakochy/known-passwords).

The password files have been compressed using bzip2 to save disk space.

Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x are required and optionally [Pip](https://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial#Installing_Distributions).

## Installing with Pip ##

Open a command prompt and execute the command:
`pip install git+git://github.com/sodasnout/checkpass`
